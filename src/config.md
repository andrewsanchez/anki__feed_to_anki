All Feeds are imported to one Note Type that is set in the key `"note type"`

`"target_fields"` requires exactly *two* fields of the Note Type set.

For each feed you must set three settings: `"URL"` (the feed source), `"DECK"` (the deck to which notes are added), and `"tags"` (the tags that are assigned for notes created from the respective feed).
