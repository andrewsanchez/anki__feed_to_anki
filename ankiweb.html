This is a modification by a third party of the the add-on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190621211526/https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1895937979" rel="nofollow">Feed to Anki (for Word of the Day RSS)</a> which was originally published by <a href="https://github.com/luminousspice/anki-addons" rel="nofollow">luminousspice</a>. This add-on creator permanently removed all of his add-ons from ankiweb in <a href="https://github.com/luminousspice/anki-addons/issues/6#issuecomment-569898310" rel="nofollow">2019-12</a>. So I reuploaded the add-on. I made some small changes. I also uploaded my version to <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__feed_to_anki" rel="nofollow">github</a>.
